The purpose of this repository is to track the Samoa measles outbreak. Data is obtained from the Government of Samoa's Twitter page (@samoagovt), which publishes regular updates. Times are in UTC (GMT), and refer to the time of the source tweet.

## How can I help?

The Government of Samoa has established a [direct donation fund](https://twitter.com/samoagovt/status/1199517609621774336) through which you can contribute to relief efforts. UNICEF NZ also has an [emergency appeal](https://www.unicef.org.nz/appeal/samoa-measles-emergency) for the measles crisis in Samoa.

## How can I contribute?

If you see a new data release (usually, these are issued between 2300 and 0400 UTC) on @samoagovt, consider adding it to the CSV file. Please adhere to the format ('tall table') adopted until now.

While I don't drink beer, I would appreciate if you could help me out by contributing via Beerpay. This helps me do helpful humanitarian projects like this alongside my work.

## How can I cite this repository?
