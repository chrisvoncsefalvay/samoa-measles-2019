# Samoa measles outbreak surveillance

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/225143525.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/225143525) 


The purpose of this repository is to track the Samoa measles outbreak. Data is 
obtained from the Government of Samoa's Twitter page (@samoagovt), which 
publishes regular updates. Times are in UTC (GMT), and refer to the time of 
the source tweet.

## How can I help?

The Government of Samoa has established a [direct donation fund]
(https://twitter.com/samoagovt/status/1199517609621774336) through which you
can contribute to relief efforts. UNICEF NZ also has an [emergency appeal]
(https://www.unicef.org.nz/appeal/samoa-measles-emergency) for the measles 
crisis in Samoa.

## How can I contribute?

If you see a new data release (usually, these are issued between 11pm and 4am 
UTC) on @samoagovt, consider adding it to the CSV file. Please adhere to the 
format ('tall table') adopted until now.

## How can I cite this repository?

Please always cite a release, as this 'freezes' your citation to a point in 
time (I'm trying to get a release done after every commit that adds to the 
data, labelled with the date). You can cite this repository as:

```

```

(Obviously, change the date to whatever the date on your repository is.)
